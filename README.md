## Description

### User Story
AS A Spotify Listener, 
I WANT TO, Be able to view my listing statics and trends 
SO THAT I can gain more insight into my listening habits

### Concept

A small web app to view your top artists and tracks on spotify.

Create an easy way to check what you listen to most on spotify. Spotify releases its own “Spotify Wrapped” every year but we thought it would be cool if there was a way to view some of those stats year-round.
